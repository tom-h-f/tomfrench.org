                Modern web development has evolved dramatically over the past few years. With the introduction
                of React 18, Next.js 13+, and improved TypeScript tooling, we have more powerful tools than
                ever to build robust, scalable applications.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading">The Current Landscape</h2>
            <p>
                Today&apos;s web applications need to be fast, accessible, and maintainable. The combination of
                server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side interactivity gives us the
                best of all worlds.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading">Key Principles</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Performance first - optimize for Core Web Vitals</li>
                <li>Accessibility by default - use semantic HTML and ARIA labels</li>
                <li>Progressive enhancement - start with HTML, enhance with JavaScript</li>
                <li>Type safety - leverage TypeScript for better developer experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading">Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                The modern stack typically includes React or similar framework, TypeScript for type safety,
                Tailwind CSS for styling, and deployment platforms like Vercel or Netlify for hosting.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building modern web applications is about finding the right balance between developer
                experience and user experience. The tools are getting better, but the fundamentals
                remain the same: build for your users first.
